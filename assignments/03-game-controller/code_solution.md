# Solution

```python
while True:
   if button.value is True: 
      if current_state is state_wait:
         keyboard.press(key)  # Send our defined key as a command...
         print("button is pressed") #Print a confirmation in the serial monitor
         keyboard.release_all()  # and release all keys again
      
         current_state = state_button_is_pressed # Update our state
        
   elif button.value is False:
      if current_state is state_button_is_pressed:
         print("button is released") # Print a confirmation in the serial monitor
         current_state = state_wait # Reset the state
      
   # Sleep for a bit to make the keypress events occur at a human timescale
   # Skilled gamers can do ~7 button presses per second (says ChatGPT)
    time.sleep(0.143)
