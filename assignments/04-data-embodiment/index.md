# Data Embodiment

![Title image](data_embodiment.jpg)

In this weeks assignment we are going to use online data to inform our design by embodying it into a physical artefact. We will use [MQTT](https://mqtt.org) (a lightweight protocol for the Internet of Things) to provide you with multiple data sources that you can use in this assignment.

The three datasources we provide are:

1. The current coordinates of the ISS and its calculated distance to IDE in Delft
2. A [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) function that returns smooth values between -1 and 1

You can follow the flow of data when going to [https://ide-education.cloud.shiftr.io](https://ide-education.cloud.shiftr.io/)

## Before we begin

For this week’s assignment, we prepared a lot of different code snippets to help you along. They are meant for you to use and **modify** for your specific design and device. Simple copy+pasting without a rough understanding of *what* you are copying **will not work!**

Although we will use a lot of code, you are not required to understand every little line, but rather analyse your needs and search for the specific code sample.

### Important!
As a prerequisite for this tutorial to work, make sure you followed and successfully completed [Tutorial 4](https://id-studiolab.github.io/Connected-Interaction-Kit/tutorials/03-connect-to-the-internet/) and connected your ItsyBitsy to the internet. 

{:.note}
   If you see the following error:    
   `File "code.py", line 6, in <module>`  
   `ImportError: no module named 'adafruit_connection_manager'`  
    then you need to update your ItsyBitsy and all the libraries. To do so, please check out [this page](https://id-studiolab.github.io/Connected-Interaction-Kit/support/)

If you’re unable to connect to the internet, don’t worry! We’ve provided an alternative method that allows you to use previously stored data from the same sources. This ensures you can still complete the tutorial and practice working with the data.

However, it’s essential to revisit this tutorial later when you have internet access. Connecting to the MQTT server is a key part of understanding how to integrate real-time data into your prototypes.
